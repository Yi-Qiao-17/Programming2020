| BIG Fibonacci |<br>
Require to build a class BigNUM to handle the big number and help driver program to calculate the "Successione di Fibonacci".<br>
| BigNUM |<br>
Require to redesign your class BigNUM with a base class "MyArray".
the MyArray will be responsible for the dynamic configuration management of the memory space, and will be used in the construction of string class in the future.
Also, your BigNUM should deal with division (operator/) and input (operator>>) now!
Beside, we ask every student to prepare your testing plan, driver program and testing report this time. Please check the attachment for more detail. (The slides has been modified slightly and add an example of reserve() )<br>
