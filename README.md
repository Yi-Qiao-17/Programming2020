| BIG Fibonacci |<br>
Require to build a class BigNUM to handle the big number and help driver program to calculate the "Successione di Fibonacci".<br>
| BigNUM |<br>
Require to redesign your class BigNUM with a base class "MyArray".
the MyArray will be responsible for the dynamic configuration management of the memory space, and will be used in the construction of string class in the future.
Also, your BigNUM should deal with division (operator/) and input (operator>>) now!
Beside, we ask every student to prepare your testing plan, driver program and testing report this time. Please check the attachment for more detail. (The slides has been modified slightly and add an example of reserve() )<br>
| Poker |<br>
Require to design a Poker dealer system, include:
Create a program to shuffle and deal a deck of cards. The program should consist of class Card, class DeckOfCards and a driver program(main_ex10_11). Then, create a class Hand, it deals a five-card poker hand. Then write functions to determine whether the hand contains. (This homework is exactly the same with midterm Problem 1)
Please refer to 1082hw5_Poker.pdf for more detail, good luck!<br>
